# **Student Performance Analysis System**

Welcome to the **Student Performance Analysis System** repository! This project is an innovative, web-based platform designed to assist educators, administrators, and institutions in evaluating and managing student academic performance effectively. The system enables educators to track student progress, identify performance trends, and make data-driven decisions to improve learning outcomes.

This system is built using **React.js** for the frontend and **Spring Boot** for the backend, providing a scalable and efficient solution. It includes features such as interactive dashboards, detailed performance analytics, and role-based access to cater to the needs of admins, teachers, and students.

## **Features**

- **Interactive Dashboard**: View and analyze student performance with graphs, charts, and key metrics.
- **Student Record Management**: Add, edit, or delete student records including grades, subjects, and other relevant information.
- **Performance Analytics**: In-depth analysis of student data by grade, subject, and time period.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different roles for Admins, Teachers, and Students with unique permissions for each.
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Use custom filters to segment performance data based on various criteria like grades, subject, etc.
- **Real-Time Data Updates**: Automatically updates student performance metrics when new data is entered.
- **Responsive Design**: The platform is optimized for use on both desktop and mobile devices.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Frontend**:
  - **React.js**: For building a dynamic, interactive, and user-friendly interface.
  - **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**: For structuring and styling the application.
  

- **Backend**:
  - **Spring Boot (Java)**: For building a robust and scalable REST API to handle business logic and database operations.
  - **MySQL/PostgreSQL**: For securely storing and managing student and performance data.
  - **Maven**: For managing backend dependencies and project configuration.


## **How It Works**

1. **Dashboard**:
   - The main dashboard provides real-time visual charts and graphs to analyze student performance, including grades, attendance, and subject proficiency.
   
2. **Student Record Management**:
   - Educators can add, edit, or delete student records including grades, subjects, and other important details.
   
3. **Performance Analytics**:
   - Teachers and admins can analyze student performance over time, by grade, or by subject using interactive charts.
   
4. **Role-Based Access**:
   - **Admins**: Full control over student records and system management.
   - **Teachers**: Ability to view and analyze performance data.
   - **Students**: Access their personal performance metrics and feedback.

5. **Dynamic Filtering**:
   - Users can filter student data based on grade, subject, or other performance criteria for more detailed analysis.

6. **Edit and Delete Records**:
   - Admins and teachers can update or remove student records as needed.

## **Installation and Setup**
